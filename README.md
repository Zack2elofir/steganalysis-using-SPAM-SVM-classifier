The blind steganalysis method proposed in this work exploits the subtractive pixel adjacency matrix for feature extraction. The choice of this algorithm is motivated by its ability to capture spatial dependencies and changes in pixel values, making it suitable for identifying alterations caused by steganographic techniques. Afterward, these features are utilized with the use of an SVM classifier.
